## General Information
- This project aims to build a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes using various features.
- BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has suffered a dip in revenues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company wants to understand the factors affecting bike demand to prepare for a post-pandemic surge.
- The dataset contains daily bike demand data across the American market, including meteorological and seasonal features.

## Conclusions
- Temperature and feeling temperature are significant predictors of bike demand.
- The year variable indicates a growing trend in bike demand, reflecting increasing popularity over time.
- Humidity and wind speed negatively impact bike demand, with higher values leading to lower rentals.
- The model's R-squared value on the test set is 0.863, indicating a good fit and predictive power.

## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.x
- pandas - version 1.x
- scikit-learn - version 0.24.x
- seaborn - version 0.11.x
- matplotlib - version 3.x

## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by the need to understand and predict bike-sharing demand for BoomBikes.
- The dataset and problem statement were provided by the consulting company contracted by BoomBikes.
- Special thanks to the open-source community for providing the necessary libraries and tools.
